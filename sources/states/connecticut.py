ARIS — Connecticut State Agent

Connecticut is highly active on comprehensive AI regulation:
  - SB 2 (2023, 2024, 2025) — Connecticut AI Act, passed Senate 2025 but did not
    reach House floor; one of the most comprehensive state AI bills attempted
  - CT Data Privacy Act (CTDPA, 2022) — in force, includes automated decisions
  - PA 24-5 (2024) — AI in hiring disclosures
  - Active 2026 pipeline: SB 2 successor expected
