ARIS — Minnesota State Agent

Minnesota is one of the most active states pursuing comprehensive AI regulation:
  - SF 2995 / HF 4397 (2024) — Minnesota AI Act, narrowly failed; reintroduced 2025
  - Follows Colorado-style risk-based framework with impact assessments
  - SF 3244 (2024) — deepfakes in elections
  - Active 2025-2026 pipeline: algorithmic accountability, employment AI, chatbots
